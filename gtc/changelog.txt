  Gii Template Collection Change Log
  ==================================

Version 0.5
-----------
- Fix: Add missing translation call for "Add new". Neutralized from "Add a new" to lessen the effect of words' gender mismatch. Note: I only added Swedish translation, the other ones need to be added. (rawtaz)
- New: Added Swedish translation. (rawtaz)
- New: Added cancel button to Create and Update form (thyseus)
- New: Make Form entries persistant with $_SESSION (thyseus)
- Chg: Move Relation Widget and CAdvancedArBehavior to extensions folder, not components/ anymore because ext.Relation looks better than application.components.Relation and there is no default Path alias for components (thyseus)
- Chg: FullCrud: Make controller template use Yii::app()->request->getQuery() and ->getPost() (from CHttpRequest unless overridden in application config) to retrieve parameters instead of directly accessing $_GET and $_POST. (rawtaz) 
- Fix: Relation: Make the widget not add a delimiter after the last field when concatenating multiple fields. (rawtaz)
- Fix: FullModel: A bug in the model template made Gii/Yii look for the CAdvancedArBehavior directly (not via path alias). (rawtaz)  
- New: Added support for generating activeDropDownList's for ENUM mysql column fields
